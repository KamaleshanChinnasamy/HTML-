  <p>A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences.<br>Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph.</p>
